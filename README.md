## Contribute To Something Great.
Opensrc is a project aimed at increasing contributions to open source software.

### The Problem
Most new developers don't realize that contributing to an open source project doesn't necessarily mean that they need to commit source code or create a new feature. Developers can contribute by finding bugs, recreating bugs/issues, editing documentation, and more.

As a budding developer it can be daunting to know where to start when it comes to contributing the the open source community. "Do I have the right skills?", "What if I mess this up?", "Will other developers laugh at me?" are just some of the questions you might ask yourself before you ever even fork a repo. You might even give up the thought of it altogether.

### The Proposed Solution
Opensrc is a project that plans to cultivate contributions to the open source community by creating a platform for developers of all skill-levels and backgrounds.

We plan to do this by providing an easy-to-navigate UI where developers have a central place to discover open source projects that they can contribute to.

Projects can be sorted by number of open issues, issue difficulty, programming language, github username or organization, and more.

### Become a Better Developer
Opensrc encourages developers to stretch that comfort zone by contributing to real-world projects. In turn, simply through practice and putting oneself out there, you will become a better overall developer.

### Contribute to opensrc.io
Naturally our own project is open source, so if you'd like to try your hand at adding a new cool feature or fixing a bug, fork away! We'd love to have you contribute to our initiative!
